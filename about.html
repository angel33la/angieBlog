    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Angella McConnell. I am a resident in Dowagiac, Michigan. I have lived here for quite awhile. However, I am looking to move away to another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I am not working anywhere but I am trying to develop the skills needed to be a web developer. I am not looking to wok at any big time companies like Google or Microsoft. I would really be quite content at a smaller business. With the hopes of one day owning my own small business. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some goals that I have set for myself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Becoming a Web Developer</li>
        <li>Getting a job at a small business</li>
        <li>Build a tiny home and move away</li>
        <li>(Long term) Become a small business owner.</li>
      </ul>
